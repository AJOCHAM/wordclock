Mode 2 – Via the GPIO
https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/how-do-i-power-my-raspberry-pi

A more technical (and of course dangerous) way to power the Pi is directly via the GPIO. It should be noted that, unlike the Micro-USB port, there is no regulation or fuse protection on the GPIO to protect from over-voltage or current spikes. If an incorrect voltage is applied, or a current spike occurs on the line you can permanently damage your Raspberry Pi. At best, you’ll “burn out” some or all of the GPIO pins, at worst you can fry your Pi! So be careful.

To power via GPIO, you only need to connect 2 pins:

1.)    Connect a 5V source to Pin #2 (5V)

2.)    Connect the ground of that source to Pin #6 (GND).
